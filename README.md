On this test I practice my English, SQL, Power Query, Data Modelling, DAX and UI skills to building a [dashboard](https://app.powerbi.com/view?r=eyJrIjoiZWVkMTIxZjYtMzQ3Zi00YjY2LWE0OTMtNjY0YmU0NmE3YzFmIiwidCI6Ijk2Njg4ZGNlLTNlYzUtNGJiZC04YjZjLWI5YzllZDNjOWI3NyJ9). 

I had 72 hours to complete all tasks wich included discovering data sources, creating measurements and arranging elements in a minimalist design.

To achieve this result I needed write a [query](https://github.com/rogeriojunio/power-bi-technical-assignment/blob/main/query.sql) with two subqueries and create four calculated columns, I concatenated excel files and collected the product list and client list using [Faker API](https://fakerapi.it/en). Then I created the following measures: orders amount, average amount per order, average orders per client, and average time to deliver (days). Finally, I had to create a bar chart, a pie chart and a table meeting specific requirements.
